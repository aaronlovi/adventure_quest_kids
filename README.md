# Adventure Quest Kids

Adventure Quest Kids is a Flutter application for a choose
your own adventure style storytelling experience for kids.

## Features

* `ParticleField` widget: Used for particle animations
* Internationalization/localization support. The entire application defaults to English,
  but is also localized to French
* YAML-based story data. Every story is entirely described by a YAML file. The images, speech
  and other support files are referenced by the YAML
    * Images were created by DALL-E
    * Story text and structure were created by ChatGPT
    * Speech files were generated by Microsoft ClipChamp
* User-settings
    * Very simple implementation of the memento pattern (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_pattern) to save and load user settings both now, and after possible structural changes in the future
* Strong routing and navigation system. Child-proof. Kids can easily navigate around the application
* Unique system to help kids follow along while each page is read out loud
    * Animation that highlights the current word on the story page as it is read
    * Tooling system to generate timestamp files so the application knows which word to highlight at any moment
* Lots of interactivity and engaging animations
    * Badges on the front page that have a unique animation - with each badge "bouncing" independently at different rates
    * Story page images have an icon animation triggered when the user taps the image
    * Story pages are read interactively when the user taps the "play" button
* Unit tests:
    * A test to ensure that every page in every story is reachable
    * A test to check the audio timestamp files, and ensure there is a timestamp for each word on each page (including localized versions)
    * A test to check each page for layout overflows even if the screen is very small (320 x 480)
* Tooling written in NodeJS
    * `audioTimestampRecorder`: Plays an audio file containing speech for a page. User taps any key to record a timestamp for each word
    * `convertWavToMp3`: Compresses .wav files to .mp3 files (to reduce final bundle sizes)
    * `resizeimages`: Dall-E images are created at 1024x1024 pixel size. This script resizes a directory of images down to 256x256 size to reduce final bundle sizes
    * `trimMp3File`: Some free audio files on the internet are minutes long when the application really only needs a few seconds of the audio track. This script extracts those few seconds and saves them to a new .mp3
    * `yamlAdventureNavigator`: Tool to traverse a story in depth-first-search fashion. Logs the path that it takes. Useful to give a path to exhaustively check all pages in a story when testing and debugging.
    * `yamlModifier`: Used to add a new YAML property to every page in a story
